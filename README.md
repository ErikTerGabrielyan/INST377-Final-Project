# INST377-Final-Project
Erik Ter-Gabrielyan's INST377 final project repository.

The github pages site where my project will be live: https://eriktergabrielyan.github.io/INST377-Final-Project/

The title of my project is UMD Search AiO (all in one).

The target browser is Chrome version 	113.0.5672.92.

The API used is the PlanetTerp API, found at https://planetterp.com/api/.

The visualizations my project uses are very basic lists of information based on search queries.

The one JS library used was jQuery.

My project is trying to display as much useful and relevant course and professor information as possible for prospective students looking to register for classes, and allow them to view key metrics such as average GPA, average professor rating, and more all in one place, as you cannot view these on the testudo schedule of classes website.
